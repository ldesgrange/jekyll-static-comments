# jekyll_static_comments #

This plugin was orinally based on [static comments][01] by Matt Palmer but I rewrote nearly everything, in order to discover a bit Ruby and having the following features:

* write comment files like post files
* allow generation of comments atom feed

More explanation about [static comments on my blog][02].
